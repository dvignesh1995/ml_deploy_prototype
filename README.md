# ML deploy prototype

This reposository serves as a prototype for deploying ml models that can used to any basic python ml models .


For example :

1) A synthetic set of programs that needs to be orchestrated with airflow is used here which can serve as
a prototype or template to quickly ship to other projects .
2) containerization of the application to make it an deploy anywhere solution


This repository mostly focusses on prototypes for MLOPS .
